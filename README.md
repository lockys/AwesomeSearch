Why
==
In a nutshell, there are too many awesome lists in the world :)    
We hope to build an application to access them more quickly.  
Maybe `awesome search` would be a helpful idea. :octocat:

Features
==
 - [x] Access and search every awesome repo collected in [sindresorhus/awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) in one page quickly.
 - [x] Access an awesome repo by `https://awesomelists.me/#repos/nodejs`.
 - [x] Categories of an awesome repo is supported if the that repo uses `headings`.
 - [x] Use Github API to retrieve README file of an awesome repo, so it's up-to-date.
 - [x] Search in a specified repo we have parsed, see [Supported repo](#supported-awesome-lists)

Supported awesome lists
==
In version 0.1.0, only two awesome lists we parsed for now :sorry:, BUT you can still view the original awesome list in awesome-search website.
- [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
- [awesome-nodejs](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs)
- [awesome-slack](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-slack)
- [awesome-osx](https://github.com/iCHAIT/awesome-osx)

We build [awesomelists-index](https://github.com/John-Lin/awesomelists-index) to parse these lists. However, we are still finding a more efficient way.
