Why
==
In a nutshell, there are many awesome lists in the world :)    
We hope to build an application to access them more quickly.  
That's why `awesome search` was born. :octocat:

Features
==
 - [x] Access and search every awesome repo collected in [sindresorhus/awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) in one page quickly.
 - [x] Access an awesome repo by `https://awesomelists.me/#repos/nodejs`. (yuo can bookmark it!)
 - [x] Categories of an awesome repo is supported if the that repo uses `headings`.
 - [x] Use Github API to retrieve README file of an awesome repo, so it's up-to-date.
 - [x] Search links in a specified repo we have parsed, see [supported repo](#supported-awesome-lists)

Supported awesome lists
==
Currently, searching `links` in most of awesome repositories is supported.    
You can see the JSON format of links [here](https://github.com/lockys/awesome.json/tree/master/output).(Contribution is welcome)  
We build [awesomelists-index](https://github.com/John-Lin/awesomelists-index) to parse these lists. However, we are still finding a more efficient way.  
[awesome.json](https://github.com/lockys/awesome.json) is the place where the data store for now.

Acceptance testing
==
We make some acceptance tests for the Web. To run the testing **Ruby** is required.

Install dependency package
```sh
bundle install
```

Run testing
```sh
rake spec
```
