- if you are going to PR a awesome list in JSON format, please follow this format
- The json file should be named by following this [map](https://github.com/lockys/awesome.json/blob/master/output/nameMap.json)
- For example, the json file of awesome-nodejs repo should be named as `nodejs` (`Node.js` ==> `nodejs` and `IoT & Hybrid Apps` ==> `iothybridapps`) 
```
{
  "Category": [
    {
      "name": "webtorrent",
      "url": "https://github.com/feross/webtorrent",
      "description": "Streaming torrent client for Node",
