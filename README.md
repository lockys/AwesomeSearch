Why
==
In a nutshell, there are too many awesome lists :)  
We hope to build a tool to access them more quickly.  
Maybe awesome-search would be a helpful idea. :octocat:

Supported awesome lists
==
In version 0.0.1, only two awesome lists we parsed for now :sorry:, BUT you can still view the original awesome list in awesome-search website.
- [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
- [awesome-nodejs](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs)
- [awesome-slack](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-slack)
- [awesome-osx](https://github.com/iCHAIT/awesome-osx)

The format of awesome lists vary, so building a general program that exacts info from them is not easy to us for now.  
We use this simple [tool](https://github.com/lockys/awesome.json) to parse these lists.
